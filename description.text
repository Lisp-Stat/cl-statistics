This is Larry Hunters cl-statistics library.  It is a single file
system with no dependencies.  The formulas and methods used are
largely taken from Bernard Rosner, *Fundamentals of Biostatistics*,
5th edition.  "Rosner x" is a page number.  Some numeric functions
were taken from CLASP, a 1994 common lisp package that implemented
some of the statistical functions from "Numeric recipes in C".
